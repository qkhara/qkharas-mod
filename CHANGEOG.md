# qkhara's mod version 1.0.0

hi! first release woo! finally got the hang of modding and added some cool stuff to the game :) 
the inital release was actually supposed to come out way before, but it totally slipped my mind and i ended up adding some new items anyway!

current changes/additions:

new blocks/items:
- 
- barrel block and vertical barrel block:
  barrel blocks take on the texture of the bottom of the vanilla barrel, vertical barrels use the side barrel texture on all 6 sides. all recipes can be found using any index mod of choice, i have no clue if the vanilla recipe book works yet
-beehive and vertical beehive block:
  beehive and vertical beehive blocks use the top texture of the crafted beehives. vertical beehive blocks are turned 90 degrees. 

recipe changes:
-
- moss+stone in a crafting table now = mossy stone from the BYG mod
- white wool can be turned into string in the crafting menu
- dried kelp in a campfire results in leather
